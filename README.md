# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2025
Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 at Purdue University Fort Wayne 

# Copied over from Qiskit Fall Fest 2024. Will be update soon.

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Purdue Universit Fort Wayne. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by **Purdue Quantum Intelligent Applications and Optimization (QIAO) Lab** sponsored by **IBM**, **Purdue Univeristy Fort Wayne Computer Science Department**, **Purude Fort Wayne ETCS**, and **National Science Foundation (NSF)**. 

We are one of 50 campuses around the world and the only one in Indiana to host the IBM sponsored [Qiskit Fall Fest Events](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/).

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the months of October to November to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local community’s skill set.

The Fall Fest here includes a series of workshops starting Oct 16 and ends with a hackathon, November 8 - 10. Details are coming.

## Hackathon
- Kick off with Hackathon Themee Revleved at 1 pm on Friday, Nov 8, ET 107
- Develop and present a Qiskit Project, a team of 1-2
- There are two types of projects
  - Develop an open project using Qiskit and create a Juypter Notebook to show potential quantum algorithms in chemistry and materials science to solve problems such as
    drug discovery, new battery, and others.
  - Complete three graded Jupyter notebooks (avaiable at 1 pm)
    - [Grade Notebook 1](https://github.com/purduequaic/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2024/blob/main/QFF_Graded_Notebook_1.ipynb)
    - [Grade Notebook 2](https://github.com/purduequaic/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2024/blob/main/QFF_Graded_Notebook_2.ipynb)
    - [Grade Notebook 3](https://github.com/purduequaic/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2024/blob/main/QFF_Graded_Notebook_3.ipynb)
- Hackathon Presentation at 5 pm, on Sunday, Nov 10
- The winning teams will be announced on 5 pm, on Wednesday, Nov 20 at this page
- The first place team will get the IBM Swags. Two winning teams, one for each type of projects.
- Participating teams will get certificates.

## Submission and Presentation
- Create a public github repository and upload your solutions.
- email github public link to Dr. Liu Liud@pfw.edu. README.md should include team members
- attend and give a presentation of 5 minuutes plus 2 minute Q & A per team at 5 pm, on Sunday, Nov 10

## Judging Criteria 
- The wiiner announcements are final.
- Originality and Uniqueness (25%)
•	Compared to what you've seen before, how unique is this project? How interesting do you find it? Did the team attempt something new or difficult?

- Usefulness and Complexity (25%)
•	Will other people be able to use this project? Was the project thoughtful in how it was designed? How functional is the project as of judging?

- Quantum Community Benefit (25%)
•	Will this project help the community at large? Can people use this for research or further develop it? Will this project help others learn and understand quantum computing?

- Presentation (25%)
•	Did the team represent their project well? Was the team able to explain why they made certain decisions? Did the entire team get a chance to speak?

## Hackathon and Challenge Rules

# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2025
Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 at Purdue University Fort Wayne 
## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Purdue Universit Fort Wayne. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by **Purdue Quantum AI Cybersecurity Lab** sponsored by **IBM**, **Purdue Univeristy Rosen Center for Advanced Computing**, **Purude Fort Wayne ETCS**, and **National Science Foundation (NSF)**. 

We are one of 55 campuses around the world and the only one in Indiana to host the IBM sponsored [Qiskit Fall Fest Events]([https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-fall-fest-2025)).

In honor of the 2025 International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, this year’s Qiskit Fall Fest theme will celebrate the century-long history of quantum science and innovation. Many of the bespoke materials we’re creating for this year’s events will center on specific experiments and notable events that occurred during that first 100 years. 

Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events that allows students, researchers and industry professionals to participate in various quantum-themed activities — including quantum challenges, hackathons, coding competitions, workshops, social events, and more. Each year, IBM® partners with a select group of university students and other volunteer hosts to help them plan and run the global roster of Fall Fest events.

The Fall Fest here includes a series of workshops, hackathons, project competition, starting Oct 15 and ends with a project competition, November 6 - 9. Details are coming.
